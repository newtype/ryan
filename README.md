## Work Experience
# Nuance Communications | Software Engineer and Computational Linguist | 2011 - present
* Worked on the XT9 and Swype keyboard platforms for mobile phones and tablets. Focused on expanding the number of languages supported and improving the performance of existing languages by leveraging natural language processing and machine learning techniques, along with linguistic research on a wide variety of languages.
* Improved and maintained a Python tool chain to produce language models and language databases. These included tools to crawl corpora, tokenize text, normalize corpus, train n-gram models, and validate language databases.
* Trained n-gram language models for numerous languages for use in word prediction and disambiguation.
* Crawled the web to gather large corpora necessary to create language models for languages such as Arabic, Croatian, Hebrew, Indonesian, and Vietnamese.
* Spearheaded the development of language databases for the languages of India, including Hindi, Tamil, Gujarati, and Malayalam.
* Designed keyboard layouts for many languages to be used in Swype. Created tools to download keyboard debug data from Android phones and validate keyboard XML definitions.

# Swype | Computational Linguist | 2010 - 2011
* Shepherded the development of languages databases from start to finish for the Swype mobile text input system. Language databases I developed include Japanese, Thai, Georgian, and Tamil. This allowed Swype to reach markets with over 250 million potential users.
* Expanded language database coverage and quality by implementing software tools. Worked on tools for context free grammars (CFGs) for grammar engineering, corpus collection, and wordlist augmentation.
* Implemented unsupervised morphological creation using machine learning techniques, including unsupervised clustering (K-Medoids) and semi-supervised constrained clustering.
* Focused on improving support for agglutinative languages, such as Japanese and Turkish, where even large corpora will not contain all possible word surface forms.
* Managed native speaker consultants and supervised their testing of language databases. Incorporated their feedback into the product.
* Played a leading role in designing the UX/UI for Swype's Japanese solution, leveraging my knowledge of the Japanese language.

# Populus Group | Linguistic Annotator | 2010
* Performed linguistic annotation on a variety of documents for the Powerset natural language search engine developers.
* Annotated web-sites for the Bing search engine research team.

## Education
# University of Washington | 2009 - 2011
MS in Computational Linguistics (3.92 / 4.0 cumulative GPA)
* Created a Question/Answer system using information retrieval as part of a three person team, achieving performance comparable to many past TREC (Text Retrieval Conference) competitors.
* Used grammar engineering to model syntax and morphology for the LinGO Grammar Matrix, a deep processing natural language grammar using the HPSG syntactic framework.
* Implemented statistical natural language processing algorithms, including Maximum Entropy, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, and Hidden Markov Models (utilizing dynamic programming techniques).
* Programmed many data structures as part of an algorithms and data structures course. These included  stacks, priority queues, directed graphs, trees, hash tables, and tries. Compared time and memory complexity of data structures and algorithms.

# University of California, Davis | 2003 - 2006
BA in Linguistics (with honors), minor in Japanese (3.97 / 4.0 major GPA, 3.8 / 4.0 cumulative GPA)
* Linguistic topics studied include phonology, phonetics, morphology, and syntax. Special focus on historical linguistics, language typology and universals, and grammaticalization.
* Research projects included Japanese historical phonology (for a graduate level course), Japanese morphology, and Native American pronominal systems.
* Implemented a morphological parser/analyzer for Japanese verbs in Prolog. Modeled the kinship terminology systems of several languages in Prolog as part of an undergraduate computational linguistics research group.
* Participated in a summer study abroad program on Japanese literature at Ryukoku University in Kyoto, Japan.

## Skills
* Primary Programming Languages: Python, C#, Java
* IDEs: Emacs, Visual Studio, NetBeans, Eclipse
* NLP Packages: Mallet, Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), Indri/Lemur, Wordnet
* Languages: English (native), Japanese (advanced), German (basic), Spanish (basic)
